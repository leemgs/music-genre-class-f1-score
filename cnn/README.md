# Musical Genre Classification
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the data was too large to store on GitHub.
After downloading the data (*.wav), I combined all of the files into a single folder called "wavfiles." For the code to run, this folder must be placed in the empty "data" folder. All of the csv files are also set to be exported to this folder. Happy coding!
